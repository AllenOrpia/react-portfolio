                    Growing up, I always imagined myself working in the medical field to assist those in need, especially at their most vulnerable times. But after I left college, I realized that working in technology had always been my calling.
                    The idea of being able to design and build my own website just seemed so appealing. 
                    Despite not working in health care, my goal is stillÂ to aid and enhance the lives of people through coding.

                    In my spare time, I like to concentrate on myself. Whether it's taking care of my general health by going to the gym to work out or play basketball. Other times, I devote significant time to research in order to enhance my skills and learn new skills.
                    Learning new languages is one example. When I'm not at the gym or learning new technologies/languages, I'm either playing video games or watching anime on Netflix.
